# Carcassonne Bot Battle
Hi, this is the repo for our bot for the SYNCS Bot Battle 2025

This repo consists of the files copied from the SYNCS public game engine, and then a unique/separate folder. Currently, it is "first_bot". That is the only file you should attempt to work on. I will update the rest of the src files and game engine files as they are patched and updated by SYNCS.
